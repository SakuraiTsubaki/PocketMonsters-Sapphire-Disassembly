# Documentation Hub

This directory is the central documentation portal for the disassembly project. Existing ROM inventories, structure notes, sprite batches, and other focused research documents remain part of the project record; this hub connects them with shared standards, version tracking, matching, and asset workflows.

## Quick links

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Project Status](PROJECT_STATUS.md) | Current reconstruction and matching stage |
| [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) | Long-term path from inventory to reproducible exact builds |
| [Version Coverage](VERSIONS.md) | Regions, languages, revisions, releases, sizes, hashes, and support status |
| [Research Guide](RESEARCH_GUIDE.md) | Evidence, naming, offsets, uncertainty, and research workflow |
| [Disassembly Standards](DISASSEMBLY_STANDARDS.md) | Shared source reconstruction standards |
| [Build and Matching](BUILD_AND_MATCHING.md) | Reproducible build and exact-match procedure |
| [Verification](VERIFICATION.md) | Unverified, Observed, Reconstructed, and Matched criteria |
| [Repository Structure](REPOSITORY_STRUCTURE.md) | Preserve the repository's verified source layout |
| [Asset Workflow](ASSET_WORKFLOW.md) | Graphics, text, audio, maps, deduplication, manifests, and review batches |
| [Manifest Guide](../manifests/README.md) | Existing and future manifest conventions |
| [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) | Contribution and pull-request expectations |

## Working flow

1. Identify the exact target in `VERSIONS.md` or existing verified inventory documents.
2. Record evidence according to `RESEARCH_GUIDE.md`.
3. Reconstruct code/data under `DISASSEMBLY_STANDARDS.md`.
4. Use `BUILD_AND_MATCHING.md` and `VERIFICATION.md` to measure progress.
5. For asset work, follow `ASSET_WORKFLOW.md` and update manifests/checksums.
6. Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `ROADMAP.md` at meaningful milestones.

Do not replace focused existing research documents with generic placeholders; link and preserve them.
